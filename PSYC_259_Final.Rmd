# Reproducibility 
In this section I will show steps I have taken to make my work easier to share
and increase its reproducibility.

##  Open Source 
I have create an OSF repository to help increase transparency and fidelity of 
my project. 

One of the major issues with my previous technique was that I had all raw data 
stored as a matrix of numbers. This matrix was accompanied by an extra document 
that was required to understand what each column represented with respect to the
experiment. To fix this I wrote a short MatLab code that converts the raw data matrix
into a table with column headers that should prove easy to understand without 
requiring an extra document or excessive commenting in the code.
