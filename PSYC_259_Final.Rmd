# Reproducibility 
In this section I will show steps I have taken to make my work easier to share
and increase its reproducibility.

##  Open Source 
I have create an OSF repository to help increase transparency and fidelity of 
my project. 

One of the major issues with my previous technique was that I had all raw data 
stored as a matrix of numbers. This matrix was accompanied by an extra document 
that was required to understand what each column represented with respect to the
experiment. To fix this I wrote a short MatLab code that converts the raw data matrix
into a table with column headers that should prove easy to understand without 
requiring an extra document or excessive commenting in the code. 


```{r}

```

##  Cleaning up

One of the major issues I have noticed with my work is poor folder and file organization. 
There is a substatial amount of time wasted in attempting to find a program, some data, or 
the most recent version of a manuscript. I have take some steps to mitegate this issue 
by reorganizing my folder and also including the manuscripts in my OSF repository. 

Below is a screen shot of my folder for this project before cleaning
