# Reproducibility 
In this section I will show steps I have taken to make my work easier to share
and increase its reproducibility.

##  Open Source 
I have create an OSF repository to help increase transparency and fidelity of 
my project. 

One of the major issues with my previous technique was that I had all raw data 
stored as a matrix of numbers. This matrix was accompanied by an extra document 
that was required to understand what each column represented with respect to the
experiment. To fix this I wrote a short MatLab program that converts the raw data matrix
into a table with column headers that should prove easy to understand without 
requiring an extra document or excessive commenting in the code.Additionally, this 
code shows good use of for loop to reduce the possibility of error in copying and 
pasting many times over. 


```
data_home= ("G:\Shared drives\Haptic Search Group Winter 2022\Experiment 2 Data_NVP")
program_home=( "C:\Users\hunte\OneDrive\Documents\MATLAB" )
Data=[];
Data_table=[];
DS_clean=[];
max_subjects=100;
num_of_sub= 0;
cd(data_home)

for si=1:max_subjects
    if exist(['Tactile_Search_2109_Experiment_2_Subject_',num2str(si),'_Block_2.csv'])
        num_of_sub= num_of_sub +1
        Data=[Data; csvread(['Tactile_Search_2109_Experiment_2_Subject_',num2str(si),'_Block_2.csv'])];
    end
end
cd(program_home);

```

This code also uses and iterative procedure to clean the data file by removing the missing
values that are generated. The program that collects this data fills in a preallocated matrix
as trials are completed and becasue we only want to analized half of the trials the matrix contains many unfilled rows. When combining each of those files you wind up with huge gaps of 
data that are all 0. 

```
for gi = 1:size(Data,1)
    if Data(gi,1) ~= 0 
    DS_clean= [DS_clean; Data(gi,:)];
    end
end
```
Now that the files are compiled and cleaned I want to save the new data as a table. 
Below is the code for that. 

```
titles= {'Year','Month','Day','Hour','Minute','Seconds','Subject','Experiment','Trial','Distractor_num','Distractor_size',...
    'Setup_time(s)','Inspection_time(s)','Search_time(s)','Input_time(s)','Accuracy'}
Data_table = array2table(DS_clean,"VariableNames",titles)
writetable(Data_table,'NVP_Clean_Data.csv')

```
The entire program can be found on my OSF page for this project. 

##  Cleaning up

One of the major issues I have noticed with my work is poor folder and file organization. 
There is a substatial amount of time wasted in attempting to find a program, some data, or 
the most recent version of a manuscript. I have take some steps to mitegate this issue 
by reorganizing my folder and also including the manuscripts in my OSF repository. 

Below is a screen shot of my folder for this project.

![During Cleaning ](Images\Haptic_Search_Folder_During.jpg)

 

![After Cleaning](Images\Haptic_Search_Folder_after.jpg)

As can be seen from the images I have added several new folders with specific 
naming conventions. I have purposefully left the important programs in the upstream 
folder in order to keep the directory calling down stream of the programs.
